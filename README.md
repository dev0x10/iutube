IUTube
======

This is a sample application using Youtube API and Angular JS.

Feature:
- Search Youtube Video (sorted by relevance, view counts, published, rating)
- Auto Repeat Video
- Load video by given Youtube video URL

What I learnt using Angular on this sample app:
- Load Youtube API on Angular run
- Creating factory
- Creating simple directive with template
- Creating controller
- Creating simple service
- Adding event listener on factory
- Using broadcast to communicate with controller

Missing:
- e2e Test

Known Issue: 
- Sometimes the Youtube IFrame not loaded (just keep refresh your browser until you see Youtube player). This is because I load the player in wrong way. Will fix it soon!
